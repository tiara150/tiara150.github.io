## Previous research

**Project Lectorate**
This is my current project. I am building a script where data sets from a transcription analysis can be downloaded via a GSE/SRA number and then a summarised experiment can be made. 

**Project Genes & proteins**
This research was about the role of the immune system during a viral infection. The aim was to find out more about Interleukin-8, which plays a role in the infection with the RS virus. 

**Project Pharmacon**
This research focused on the effect of the pharmaceutical compound Lithium on the C. Elegans in relation to Alzheimer's disease. 

**Project Biomolecular Research**
This research dealt with the absorption of the fatty acids EPA and DHA in muscle cells. It also examined where the fatty acids go after absorption.
